# App for learning English by translating words
The application is purposefully designed to be annoying. Upon launch the user is prompted to translate 5 words from English into Russian, then the program checks the answers and, in case of an incorrect translation, shows the correct one. Then the application window closes for N minutes, after which it reopens on top of all active windows. The application is not displayed on the bottom panel or the tray, thus forcing lazy users to take the time to translate words.
