# App for learning English by translating words
The application is purposefully designed to be annoying. Upon launch the user is prompted to translate 5 words from English into Russian, then the program checks the answers and, in case of an incorrect translation, shows the correct one. Then the application window closes and reopens after N minutes on top of all active windows. The application is not displayed on the bottom panel or the tray, thus forcing lazy users to take the time to translate words.
